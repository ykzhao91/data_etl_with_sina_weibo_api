# data_etl_with_sina_weibo_api

Spring 2016

I was part of a start-up business, which focused on helping wedding planners, agency and photographer to showcase their work and portfolio. They are building a software tool to automatically create a H5 page of the images and music, which can be shared later on other social media platform.

Therefore, it’s very important to identify the target clients for their business at the stage of promotion and marketing. And it’s crucial to analyze users and followers activities with in the social media platform. I hope to find some data related to the wedding agency or planners who are already on social media, and discover interesting stories behind the numbers.

I programmed with Python and called APIs by 'Sina Weibo' (a SNS, Chinese version 'Twitter’ ), returned 2,847 user accounts and 9,299 tweets in total for my data analysis. I was able to identify how geo location, population, followers’ engagement and type of the tweets correlate with each other, thus reflecting the wedding market in China. Afterwards, I used Tableau to import my datasets and visualize the results using map, bar, pie, etc to showcase the research findings to clients and stakeholder.
